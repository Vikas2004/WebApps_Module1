This is the basic information of my favourite Cricketer. He was born on December 12, 1981 and played for Indian national team from 2000 to 2019. He is not just a cricketer but also an inspiration to many as he overcame his cancer and made his comeback into the team.  Here I am going to try to tell few of his achivements and a short glimpse of his career.
